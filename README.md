# Product-Recommendation-for-Walmart-Products

This project builds a content-based recommendation system using product descriptions. It leverages TF-IDF and cosine similarity to suggest relevant products, improving customer experience and boosting conversions.

üìå Problem Statement
Vast Product Selection
Customers struggle to find relevant products in large catalogs.

Need for Personalization
Tailored recommendations improve satisfaction and engagement.

Improved Discovery & Conversion
Smart suggestions help users find what they need, faster.

üîß Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Remove duplicates, handle missing values.

Extract relevant features from product descriptions.

Standardize and transform text data.

2. TF-IDF Vectorization
Converts product descriptions into numerical vectors.

Highlights important words while reducing less-informative ones.

3. Cosine Similarity
Measures similarity between products using vector angle.

Products with highest similarity scores are recommended.
